# 📚 Demonstration

## Steps:

1. Deploy contracts
2. Mint NFT using account A. When entering `_royaltyNumerator`, use the scheme (5.00% --> entered as 500). Solidity does not like decimals.
3. Send NFT to account B
4. List NFT using account B
5. Approve the Marketplace to take the NFT using account B
6. Using account C buy the NFT from account B. (If using ERC20 as payment, must approve.)
7. Notice Royalty sent to account A after transaction between accounts B and C.
