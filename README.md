## Introduction

The staking works on the logic of Weighted average depending on the price of the public good project governance token hence this repositiory assumes that the projects users can stake in have a token and it is a [retroactive erc20 token](https://github.com/scaffold-eth/scaffold-eth-examples/tree/erc20-retroactive-funding), there can be other factors to determine weightage but probably the price was the most logical one.

## Points to remember 
- The main [contract](https://github.com/scaffold-eth/scaffold-eth/blob/public-goods-staking/packages/hardhat/contracts/WeightageSplit.sol) basically is a flattened version, so it has 2 contracts, [PublicGoodToken](https://github.com/scaffold-eth/scaffold-eth/blob/public-goods-staking/packages/hardhat/contracts/WeightageSplit.sol#L761) & [Weightage](https://github.com/scaffold-eth/scaffold-eth/blob/public-goods-staking/packages/hardhat/contracts/WeightageSplit.sol#L931)

- The voting rights i.e the public goods project tokens the user get's on staking is the instance of the PublicGoodToken.

- While deploying the contracts currently in the [deployment script](https://github.com/scaffold-eth/scaffold-eth/blob/public-goods-staking/packages/hardhat/deploy/00_deploy_your_contract.js), we assume 2 public good tokens, you can update it based on your convinience.

- The initial price when you first navigate into UI is 1, so you need to fund project token's uniswap v3 pool with eth and sell your tokens in order to update price check the readme [here](https://github.com/scaffold-eth/scaffold-eth-examples/blob/erc20-retroactive-funding/README.md).

The project token detail page where you can do two operations, fund the project token uniswap v3 pool with eth and swap your tokens for eth to update price.
