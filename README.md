# 🏗 eth.dev

## Start the game

```bash
# 1. Terminal
# start local chain
$ yarn
$ yarn chain

# 2. Terminal
# start eth.dev app
$ yarn start
```

## Create a new level

The different game levels are located at `packages/eth-dev-src/components/levels/`.

To add a new level duplicate one of the level folders.

Then do a find+replace using the folder name of the level you copied and replace all occurances with your new level name.
It is important that you respect upper and lower cases!
